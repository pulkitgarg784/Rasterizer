This is a simple software renderer that started out based on [Tiny Renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer),
but now may or may not resemble it at all. I am building this as a learning exercise to understand how to build a game engine
from scratch, starting with the renderer, with minimal external dependencies (currently only SDL2 for windowing and input handling).
